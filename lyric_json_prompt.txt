Read this pdf and for each line in the score, give following in JSON format:
-Measure number, where the line starts
-Lyrics for each staff, keep dashes.
-try to align the strings similarly as in the pdf: e.g. Add empty space if the lyrics start at halfway through the line
[

        "measure_start": 1,
        "1": "Ex-amp-le-ly-ric",
        "2": "Ex-amp-le-ly-ric"
