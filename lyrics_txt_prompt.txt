Here is a PDF and auto-generated lyrics.
Fix incorrect spelling using PDF as the authoritative source.
Keep same formatting, new lines, etc.
Treat underscore as an empty syllable.
Each line has the form: staffNum [syllable_count]: tokens
The number in brackets is the required syllable count for that voice in that measure. You must keep exactly that many syllables (tokens) when fixing the text; do not change the bracket number.
Syllables are separated by space or dash (hyphen joins multi-syllable words).

Give result as .txt file. Do not use pandoc or any formatting conversion.
Write the .txt file only. Save as "lyrics_fixed.txt". remember new lines
